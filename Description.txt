(i)   Learn executable sets a and b coefficients
      based on the given data
      Data should be in the format: <double>, <double>
(ii)  Assess executable gives corresponding y to a given x
      (e. g. given mileage, returns price)
(iii) ShowPrecision executable 

h(x, a, b) = a + b * x
cost(a, b) = (1/2m)*sum((h(xi)-yi)^2)
goal: min(cost(a, b))
    where h is a hypothesis
          a, b - coefficient to find
